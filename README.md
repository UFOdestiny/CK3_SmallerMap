# CK3 Smaller Map
This mod is designed to reduce the size of world map in Crusader King 3 to improve the performance, which is published in [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3488444772).   

## Tutorial  
1. Paint over the baronies you wish to remove in color of the impassible terrain on map_data/**provinces.png**.
2. Removing titles from common/landed_titles/00_landed_titles.txt
3. Removing the affected holy sites in common/religion/holy_sites/00_holy_sites.txt along with the files in common/religion/religions.
4. Modify the common/scripted_effects/00_ai_value_effects.txt to ensure the conquers spawn.
5. (optional) Removing affected historical characters in history/characters and titles in history/titles.
6. (optional) Removing affected bookmarks.
